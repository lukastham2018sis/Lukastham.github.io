COVID19

As reported in the news, In South Korea, there is a higher chance of males facing fatality from the COVID19 Virus compared to females. However, there are a higher number of COVID19 cases
in females than males. As reported, at least 30% and of patients who have existing illnesses faces fatality from the COVID19 virus. And more so, as reported, those elderly are vulnerable to the disease.

Lastly, I performed a Navies Bayes Machine Learning algorithm to predict the outcome of a certain patient. Using Sex and Infectious Case, we can analyse whether a patient from a certain gender, getting the virus from a certain source, will 
give an outcome of what will happen to the patient.

I am still trying to improve the model and add more information.
